Description: We visualize the standard deviation of a data set as the radius of a cylinder whose volume equals the total volume of several cylinders made by revolving the empirical cumulative distribution function about the vertical line through the mean. For more details see Sarkar and Rashid (2016) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1165734>.
